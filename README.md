## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You can call me Oxium, Ox, or Chris (he/him).

I'm new to coding and Git. I'm curretnly experimenting with Twine to write a short game. I hope to write at a game studio in the future, but I need some experience first. I didn't go to school for game development or even take a computer science class. Like a lot of things in my life, I've opted to self-teach. Much cheaper!

More about me:
- I live near Seattle, WA
- I love the ocean, forests, and PNW
- I have a dog named Mona and a cat named Evie
- I play games on PC and PlayStation mostly
